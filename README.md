# C
KISS C application examples

Basically some popular tiny challenges that people struggle with when starting to learn C.
Can be described as 'didactic examples'. 

# matrix.c
  example application for an simple Matrix-struct and a function that evaluates if a given Matrix is symetric
# pyramid.c
  asks for number of rows, prints all odd numbers in a pyramid
  
# bitToggle.c
  example of how to toggle, invert, set, get bits in a bitfield
 
# hexDump.c
  cool tool to analyze the memory of string in c, very didactic :)
  
# intHexBin.c
  tool that helps in understanding the different representations of values: dez, hex, bin

# retCharPtr.c
  This example shows why in C one can't simply return an dynamicaly long string from a function
  it explains call-by-reference, dynamical allocation with malloc, and defunct returning utilizing the popular local-scope mistake

#intToBin.c
  Simple reading of programm argument, parsing it from char* to int using itoa(..), then converting it to a binary-string with a  function by call-by-reference.
